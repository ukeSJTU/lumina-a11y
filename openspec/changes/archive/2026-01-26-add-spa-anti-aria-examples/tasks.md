## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create `examples/spa-route-navigation/` with History API view swaps and dynamic content containing icon-only controls and missing-alt images.
- [x] 1.2 Create `examples/spa-async-content/` that renders content after a delayed async fetch simulation, including icon-only controls and missing-alt images.
- [x] 1.3 Create `examples/spa-infinite-scroll/` that appends items on scroll (or a virtualized list), including icon-only controls and missing-alt images.
- [x] 1.4 Update `examples/README.md` and `README.md` to document the new SPA examples and how to trigger their behaviors.
- [x] 1.5 Manual validation: serve each SPA example and confirm the dynamic content appears and remains unlabeled without WebIlluminator.
