## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Create `examples/web-components-shallow` with open Shadow DOM elements that include icon-only controls and images missing `alt`.
- [x] 1.2 Create `examples/web-components-deep` with nested open Shadow DOM components showing the same two anti-patterns.
- [x] 1.3 Create `examples/web-components-mixed` that combines shallow and deep components on one page.
- [x] 1.4 Extend the content script to scan open Shadow DOM roots, include shadow-host context in element descriptions, and clear markers inside shadow roots.
- [x] 1.5 Update `README.md` to list and describe the new examples.
- [x] 1.6 Manual validation: serve each new example and confirm overlays/labels appear for Shadow DOM elements and closed roots are ignored.
