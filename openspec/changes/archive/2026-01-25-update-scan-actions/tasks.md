## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Update popup layout (Save row, Scan/Fix row) and add Fix button wiring.
- [ ] 1.2 Add message handlers to support scan-only and fix flows, including reuse of the last scan mapping and a console log when Fix auto-scans.
- [ ] 1.3 Manual smoke test in Chrome: Scan shows overlays only; Fix reuses prior scan or auto-scans and logs the message; layout matches requirements.
