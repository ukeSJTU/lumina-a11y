- Does the project demonstrate quality application development? Does the project leverage Gemini 3? Is the code of good quality and is it functional? 
- **Potential Impact - 20%**

The highest-scoring Submission for each category will be selected as the potential winner(s). The highest-scoring Submission across all categories will win the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission with the next highest score will become the potential winner. Determinations of judges are final and binding.

In the event that no entries are received for a region, no prize will be awarded.
