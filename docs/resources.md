## Resources

The free tier is only available in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apps). To get started, access the [Build tab of AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/build) to easily and quickly build advanced applications. You can also find existing templates to get started in our [Gallery](https://aistudio.google.com/apps?source=showcase&showcaseTag=gemini-3).

## Inspiration

Need a spark? Start here. Gemini 3 isn’t just a chatbot—it’s a multimodal reasoning engine. It can see, hear, and understand the world in real-time. Don't just build a text interface; build something that senses and reacts.

The launch of Gemini 3 signals the start of the Action Era, transitioning from static chat to autonomous agents that plan and execute complex, long-running tasks. This global hackathon, hosted by Google DeepMind and Devpost challenges you to build high-fidelity AI-powered applications using the Gemini API.

**We strongly discourage the following types of projects:** 

In the Action Era, if a single prompt can solve it, it is not an application. We are looking for orchestrators building robust systems using the Gemini API in Google AI Studio.

- Baseline RAG: Gemini 3 Pro features a verified 1M token context window. It natively reasons over entire codebases and document sets; simple data retrieval is now a baseline feature.
- Prompt Only Wrappers: Applications that are merely system prompts in a basic UI.
- Simple Vision Analyzers: Basic object identification is obsolete. We want to see spatial-temporal video understanding that recognizes cause and effect.
- Generic Chatbots: Standard bots for nutrition, job screening, or personality analysis.
- Medical Advice: No projects generating medical or mental health diagnostic advice.

### Strategic Tracks

These tracks focus on market potential and technical depth. We encourage you to innovate beyond these prompts to showcase the full potential of Gemini 3 Pro.

🧠 **The Marathon Agent:** Build autonomous systems for tasks spanning hours or days. Use Thought Signatures and Thinking Levels to maintain continuity and self-correct across multi-step tool calls without human supervision.

- ☯️ **Vibe Engineering:** Leverage the Google AI Studio Build tab and Google Antigravity. Build agents that do not just write code but verify it through autonomous testing loops and browser-based verification artifacts.
- 👨‍🏫 **The Real-Time Teacher:** Use the Gemini Live API to synthesize live video and audio for adaptive learning.
- 🎨 **Creative Autopilot:** Combine Gemini 3 reasoning with Nano Banana Pro for high-precision multimodal creation. Use higher resolution and localized Paint-to-Edit controls to generate professional, brand-consistent assets with legible text
